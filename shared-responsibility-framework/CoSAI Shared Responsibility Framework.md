# 1. Executive Summary

The evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) necessitates a refined approach to accountability within AI systems. Given the criticality of clear understanding of accountability and responsibility across shared systems - including AI systems, we introduce an expanded framework that aligns with and extends established AI Shared Responsibility Frameworks (SRF) \[[5](#ref-5),[16](#ref-16)\]. This model is designed to identify accountability across the AI ecosystem, with examples addressing industry-specific regulatory requirements and model supply chain risks.

The implementation of non-trivial business-specific AI systems presents organizations with significant accountability gaps \[[1](#ref-1)\]. Incidents involving AI system failures, harm caused, or regulation violations often lead to complex scenarios where identifying the responsible parties becomes challenging due to blurred responsibility boundaries \[[2](#ref-2)\]. Such ambiguities both delay resolution and impede effective incident response and regulatory compliance \[[3](#ref-3), [4](#ref-4), [6](#ref-6), [7](#ref-7)\]. Emerging agentic AI systems capable of semi-autonomous operations on behalf of humans or other agents create new challenges in accountability.

CoSAI uses enterprise architecture layers to address the critical issues and complexities in responsibility posed by modern AI systems. This expands on the architectural view of responsibility by adding additional layers inherent in solutions using AI.  CoSAI has added **AI Business** to the **Usage** layer to address Industry-Specific Regulatory Compliance, added **AI Information layer** to include data owners, and the **AI Model Provider** to address the Supply Chain.  While organizational structures are manifold, and personas and their roles may vary widely from one organization to another, the dependencies encoded in the enterprise architecture layers remain invariant when provisioning, building or operating AI systems. The CoSAI Shared Responsibility Framework provides a governance manual for decomposing AI system solutions into components with one accountable party.

**Key Takeaways**

* 5 layers provide clear accountability across AI systems  
* Close regulatory compliance gaps with solution decomposition  
* Addresses the AI agentic governance challenges resulting from accelerated adoption  
* Provides implementation playbooks and evidence requirements

# 2. Current state and challenges

The advent of AI-enabled systems has ushered in an era characterized by probabilistic behaviors and novel risks emanating from user-generated content, training data, and the model providers themselves. Recognizing these challenges, numerous industry regulators have proactively introduced governance frameworks specifically tailored to address AI-related concerns pertinent to their respective sectors.

In response to this evolving landscape, we present a strategic framework designed for identifying responsible component owners and assigning accountability.  This structure depicts dependencies and responsibilities across the AI ecosystem. Our approach aims to ensure alignment with multiple industry regulations while fostering transparency and trust among all stakeholders involved in the deployment and operation of AI systems.

## 2.1 Current State Pain Points

Ambiguous ownership is a growing liability for AI system deployments. These pain points underscore why a formal shared responsibility model is no longer optional for AI.

* **Vendor Complexity**: When a single application relies on disparate model providers, cloud platforms, and agent frameworks, isolated contracts create operational blind spots. Critical handoffs fail when no one has full-stack oversight.  
* **Incident response**: When an adverse event spans multiple layers of an AI system, triage stalls. Without explicitly assigned owners for detection, containment, and remediation, teams default to the finger-pointing cycle.  
* **Regulatory compliance**: Demonstrating adherence to AI-specific mandates, such as data governance, bias testing, or model validation, fails instantly when organizations cannot map specific controls to designated owners across the value chain.  
* **Shadow AI proliferation:** Unsanctioned AI usage thrives in the gray areas between IT security, business units, and external vendors. Left unassigned, no single group monitors for rogue usage or owns the risk of sensitive data exposure.

CoSAI’s five-layer framework addresses these pain points by establishing exactly a clear accountable party for each component across the full AI system.

### 2.1.1 Vendor Management Complexity

AI system procurement may include the following parties:

* Foundation model providers    
* Specialized AI platform providers  
* Agentic system providers   
* Application developers  
* End Organizations with sector-specific constraints and regulations (Healthcare, Finance, Public Sector)

### 2.1.2 Examples of AI regulatory impact in Industry

* **Healthcare**: FDA AI/ML guidance creates new validation requirements \[[8](#ref-8)\] not covered by traditional cloud models, and subsequent requirements cascade down the layers. Without clear responsibility assignment, organizations cannot determine who validates model changes or documents compliance.  
* **Financial Services**: SR 11-7 model risk management \[[9](#ref-9)\] applies differently to AI than traditional software, where risk also cascades down supporting layers. Ambiguous accountability makes it impossible to assign model risk ownership across the multi-vendor AI stack.  
* **Public Sector**: NIST AI RMF requirements \[[10](#ref-10)\] span multiple organizational boundaries, between organizations and within each organization.The framework enables government agencies to map NIST controls to specific accountable parties across vendor relationships.  
* **Consumer Protection**:   
  * **Airline**: In 2022, a national carrier was sued by a customer after the airline failed to honor a claim made by its chatbot that contradicted its actual bereavement policy. A Canadian court held the organization responsible, making it pay $812.02 to the customer \[[13](#ref-13)\].  
  * **Car Dealership**: By negotiating with the chatbot of a car dealership to agree without seeking proper authorization, a customer manipulated the chatbot to agree to sell a 2024 Chevy Tahoe for $1 \[[17](#ref-17)\].  

## 2.2 Use Case Example

Consider a prompt injection attack that bypasses guardrails in a customer-facing chatbot, exposing PII from a connected database. Under the five-layer model, accountability traces cleanly:

The AI Model Provider is accountable for the base model's susceptibility to prompt injection and for documenting known weaknesses in the model card. The Cloud/AI Platform Provider is accountable for infrastructure-level protections such as tenant process isolation that contain blast radius. The Application Developer is accountable for implementing application-level guardrails, input validation, and data access controls that should have prevented the chatbot from reaching PII in the first place. The deploying organization is accountable for having classified that data appropriately, defining which data the chatbot could access, and maintaining incident response procedures.

Without this layered accountability, the typical outcome is the cycle described above: the model provider blames configuration, the cloud provider points to the tenant, and the application team cites model limitations. The framework turns "whose fault is this?" into "which layer's controls failed, and who owns remediation for each?" This is an example that highlights the complexity and the two prompt injection responsibility points including the upstream and downstream data sources. Details of this example can be found in Appendix A.3.6.

# 3. The CoSAI AI Shared Responsibility Framework

**CoSAI AI Responsibility Framework**   
The SRF is primarily an accountability framework, it answers *who* is responsible for each component across the AI stack. It complements rather than replaces existing control and management frameworks: NIST AI RMF defines *what* governance outcomes to achieve, ISO/IEC 42001 defines *how* to manage an AI management system, and EU AI Act defines *which* regulatory obligations apply by risk tier. Compliance controls referenced throughout this document illustrate how accountability at each layer is discharged in practice; they are not requirements of the SRF itself.  

There should be exactly one accountable party per component to prevent overlaps.  Specific Security & Governance requirements cascade  from the Business layer to the supporting layers. The layers illustrate areas of responsibility where personas reflect types of actors who are accountable. For additional detail on the Cloud SRM, consult **Appendix A1**.

Depending on the solution operating model, IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS, the solution layers and their components will be provided by different entities, understanding which is key to assigning responsibility.  Enterprise solutions are unlikely to be monolithically operating within one model, so defining the operating model for AI system components may be necessary.  Responsibility is shared between customers and providers at the boundary of what is being provided, and the enterprise architecture layers indicate governance activities mandated to personas responsible for that solution layer.  The CoSAI Shared Responsibility Framework answers “Who is responsible, internally and externally, for issues with AI systems?” 

| Principle:  *There should be exactly one accountable party per activity to prevent overlaps.* |

The matrix uses color coding to show the ownership of each function: Provider, Shared, Customer, or Model Dependent. The structure reveals how responsibility is allocated across the stack. As the service matures and moves from Infrastructure-as-a-Service to Software-as-a-Service, the Provider takes on increasing responsibility for managing the complex technological stack. However, the matrix shows that critical, non-technical ownership—specifically Business Strategy, Data Governance, and the ultimate definition of the use case—remains consistently with the Customer, regardless of the service model utilized.](/shared-responsibility-framework/images/srf-img-v1.png)

## 3.1 Personas

While the Enterprise Architecture layers provide solution dependencies that indicate governance components, the heterogeneity of solutions means that the persona for a given activity may vary from solution to solution. The framework recognizes areas of responsibility, aligned with the eight CoSAI-RM Personas \[[22](#ref-22)\]:

  * Guaranteeing uptime, providing platform-level incident notification, and defining SLAs that bound the platform’s contribution to any AI system incident response timeline.

## 3.2 Cloud Operating Models

The AI Shared Responsibility Framework applies across multiple deployment and service models. Understanding how responsibilities shift across these Cloud operating models (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) is critical for organizations to properly assign accountability and manage risk. This section maps the framework layers to standard cloud service models, enhanced to address AI-specific considerations.

Each Cloud operating model represents a different distribution of control and responsibility between providers and consumers, impacting layers of the framework: AI Business & Usage, AI Information, AI Applications, AI Platform, and AI Model Providers. Detailed breakdown and definitions of the matrix can be found in **Appendix A.2**.

### 3.2.1 Cloud Operating Models Responsibility Matrix

**Direction:** Columns progress left to right from most provider-managed (AI-SaaS) to most customer-managed (IaaS). Customer responsibility increases as organizations move toward infrastructure-layer deployments.  
**Legend: Provider-managed** . provider owns and operates; customer inherits controls. **Shared** . both parties have defined, complementary obligations (see Section 3.1 personas). **Customer-owned** . customer has full accountability; provider offers no default controls. **N/A** . this layer does not apply in this operating model.

| Layer | Responsibility | AI-SaaS *(Managed app)* | AI-PaaS *(Managed platform)* | Agent-PaaS *(Agentic platform)* | IaaS |
| :---- | ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **AI Business & Usage** | **Customer** | Shared | Customer-owned | Customer-owned | Customer-owned |
|  | **Provider** | Provider-managed | Provider-managed | Provider-managed | Provider-managed |
| **AI Information** | **Customer** | Shared | Shared | Shared | Customer-owned |
|  | **Provider** | Provider-managed | Provider-managed | Provider-managed | Provider-managed |
| **AI Application** | **Customer** | Shared | Shared | Shared | Customer-owned |
|  | **Provider** | Provider-managed | Provider-managed | Provider-managed | Provider-managed |
| **AI Platform** | **Customer** | Shared | Shared | Shared | Customer-owned |
|  | **Provider** | Provider-managed | Provider-managed | Provider-managed | Provider-managed |
| **AI Model Provider** | **Customer** | N/A | Model evaluation | Shared | Customer-owned |
|  | **Provider** | Provider-managed | Provider-managed | Provider-managed | Provider-managed |

## 3.3 Conclusion

We present the AI Shared Responsibility Framework, which is specifically designed to address the critical accountability gaps emerging in complex, multi-vendor Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Our framework builds upon existing shared responsibility concepts, providing a necessary refinement for the new era of AI deployment, especially with the rise of autonomous agentic systems.

The framework provides clear accountability for every component across the AI ecosystem, directly tackling operational pain points such as vendor complexity, incident response gaps, and regulatory compliance risks that arise from unclear ownership. Key to our innovation is the introduction of two layers: one dedicated to ensuring Industry-Specific Regulatory Compliance and another focused on managing the Foundational Model Supply Chain.

By clearly defining responsibilities across distinct personas this framework facilitates a structured approach to identifying AI responsibility. Through its clear accountability structures and accompanying implementation playbook, this model is positioned to be a foundational tool for organizations seeking to manage the complex liabilities and operational risks of AI, ensuring the framework remains robust and adaptable to the rapidly evolving landscape of agentic and regulated AI technologies.

# A. Appendix

## A.1 Responsibility Domains and Five-Layer Framework

**Existing Cloud SRM 3-layer models \[[5](#ref-5), [12](#ref-12), [16](#ref-16)\] (what CoSAI adds)**

| Capability | 3-Layer (Existing) | 5-Layer (CoSAI) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Regulatory compliance accountability | Ambiguous | Explicit in Layer 1 - Business |
| Training data governance | Not addressed | Explicit in Layer 5 - Model Provider |
| Agentic system boundaries | Not addressed | Explicit in Layer 3 - Application |
| Shadow AI governance | Not addressed | Explicit in Layer 2 - Information |
| Multi-vendor coordination | 2 personas | 5 personas with clear RACI |

**Framework Relationships**: 

* **NIST AI RMF**: Complementary. NIST defines what to do (GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE); CoSAI AI SRF defines who does it, use them together.   
* **ISO 42001**: Complementary. CoSAI AI SRF provides an accountability structure that can satisfy ISO 42001 Clause 5.3 requirements.

**Adoption**:   
Organizations with existing Azure shared responsibility documentation can map their current assignments to the 5-layer structure using the matrices in Section 3.2.1.  Note: AWS has no published AI SRM as of publication date.

**Versioning**:   
The framework uses semantic versioning. Minor versions (1.x) add components; major versions (x.0) may restructure layers. See A.6 for evolution approach.

### A.1.1 AI Business Vertical

**NEW**: Addresses sector-specific AI governance requirements for regulated organizations

**Scope**: How organizations in regulated industries implement sector-specific AI regulations, compliance frameworks, and industry standards governing AI system deployment.

**Primary Focus**: Regulated entities' responsibilities for achieving and maintaining compliance across their AI system implementations

**Why This Layer Matters**: Traditional cloud compliance doesn't address AI-specific regulations such as FDA AI/ML guidance, SR 11-7 model risk management, or EU AI Act high-risk system requirements. Regulated organizations need clear accountability frameworks for implementing these requirements across their technology stack.

### A.1.2 AI Information

Enhanced from existing three layer models \[[5](#ref-5), [12](#ref-12), [16](#ref-16)\] to include agentic systems

**Scope**: How AI capabilities are consumed by end users, including emerging autonomous agent systems.

#### A.1.2.1 Core Components Responsibility Matrix

| Component | AI Model Provider | Cloud/Platform Provider | Agentic Provider | Application Developer | End User/Organization |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **User Training & Accountability** | Support | Support | Support | **Responsible** | **Accountable** |
| **Usage Policy & Admin Controls** | Not Involved | Support | Support | **Responsible** | **Accountable** |
| **Identity & Access Management** | Not Involved | **Responsible** | Support | Support | **Accountable** |
| **Content Filtering & Moderation** | **Accountable** | Support | Support | Support | **Responsible** |

#### A.1.2.2 Agentic Information Considerations

Agentic AI systems introduce distinct information handling responsibilities beyond those of traditional AI deployments. When agents autonomously retrieve, generate, or route information across tools and APIs, the accountability for that information does not automatically follow existing data governance assignments.

**Data Minimization for Agents**: Application Developers (3.1.2) are responsible for scoping agent memory and retrieval to the minimum data necessary for the task. Organizations (3.1.5) are accountable for defining data classification rules that bound which information categories agents may access or retain across sessions.

**Cross-Agent Information Flows**: In multi-agent architectures, information passed between agents (including context, tool outputs, and retrieved documents) must be subject to the same governance controls as direct user data. Agentic Platform providers (3.1.1) are responsible for providing inter-agent communication controls; Application Developers are responsible for configuring them.

**Retention and Ephemeral State**: Agent session state, including intermediate reasoning steps and tool call history, may constitute a record under applicable data regulations. AI System Governance actors (3.1.5) must define whether agent session logs are subject to retention schedules, and AI Platform Providers (3.1.8) must provide configurable log lifecycle controls to satisfy those requirements.

#### A.1.2.3 AI Tool Usage Governance

Scope: Individual and departmental consumption of AI services (ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Claude, etc.) outside of formal enterprise AI applications, including both sanctioned and shadow AI usage.

**Key Governance Areas:**

**Acceptable Use Policies:**

* Organizational rules governing employee use of external AI services  
* Data classification boundaries (what data can/cannot be processed)  
* Use case restrictions (prohibited applications, approval requirements)  
* Productivity vs. business-critical usage distinctions

**Data Loss Prevention & Privacy:**

* Preventing sensitive data exposure through external AI tools  
* Intellectual property protection in AI tool interactions  
* Customer data handling restrictions for AI service usage  
* Integration with existing DLP systems and monitoring

**Shadow AI Detection & Management:**

* Discovery of ungoverned AI tool usage across the organization  
* Network monitoring for AI service API calls and web usage  
* Departmental AI spending and subscription tracking  
* Risk assessment of discovered AI tool implementations

**Integration Boundary Management:**

* Criteria for when AI tool usage becomes an enterprise application  
* Governance escalation triggers (usage volume, data sensitivity, business criticality)  
* Migration pathways from tool usage to formal enterprise AI systems

#### A.1.2.4 AI Tool Usage Responsibility Matrix

| Component | AI Service Provider | Cloud/Platform Provider | Application Developer | End User/Organization |
| ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Acceptable Use Policy Development** | Not Involved | Not Involved | Not Involved | **Accountable** |
| **AI Tool Data Governance** | **Accountable** | Support | Support | **Responsible** |
| **Shadow AI Detection** | Not Involved | Support | Not Involved | **Accountable** |
| **Usage Monitoring & Enforcement** | Support | Support | Not Involved | **Accountable** |
| **Tool-to-Enterprise Integration** | Support | Support | **Responsible** | **Accountable** |

### A.1.3 AI Application

Expanded from existing three layer models \[[5](#ref-5), [12](#ref-12), [16](#ref-16)\] to include agentic applications

**Scope**: Applications and services that integrate AI capabilities, from traditional AI-enhanced applications to full agentic systems.

#### A.1.3.1 Key Components and Responsibilities:

| Component | AI Model Provider | Cloud/Platform Provider | Agentic Provider | Application Developer | End User/Organization |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Application Design & Implementation | Not Involved | Support | Support | **Accountable** | **Responsible** |
| AI Plugins & Data Connections | Support | Support | Support | **Accountable** | **Responsible** |
| Application Safety Systems | Support | Support | Support | **Accountable** | **Responsible** |
| Integration Security | Not Involved | Support | Support | **Accountable** | **Responsible** |

#### A.1.3.2 Agentic Application Considerations

**Tool & API Access Controls:**

* **Application Developers**: Design secure integration patterns, implement access boundaries  
* **Application Adversarial Testing**: Red team validation against known AI system attack vectors  
* **Organizations**: Define business rules, monitor tool usage  
* **Platform Providers**: Provide secure API gateways, rate limiting  
* **Agentic Providers**: Implement agent permission frameworks

**Agentic Telemetry Requirements:**

* Agent identity and session context  
* Tool/API invocations with parameters  
* Reasoning chain / chain-of-thought (if available)  
* Inter-agent communications  
* Human override events  
* Boundary violation attempts

For a comprehensive threat model covering agentic system security risks, including tool poisoning, credential theft, and confused deputy attacks, see the CoSAI WS4 MCP Security Paper \[[18](#ref-18)\]. The responsibility assignments in this section should be evaluated against the threat categories identified in that paper to ensure coverage across the full attack surface.

**Human Override Capabilities:**

* **Critical Requirement**: All autonomous agents must have immediate human intervention capability  
* **Implementation**: Application developers must build override mechanisms (responsible)  
* **Governance**: Organizations must define override policies and training (accountable)

Example human intervention table

| Tier | Type | Trigger | Response Time | Authority |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| T1 | Soft guidance | Minor threshold breach | Async | Automated |
| T2 | Active redirect | Approaching boundary | .5 min | AI Ops |
| T3 | Pause & Review | Policy breach | .1 min | Senior AI Ops |
| T4 | Immediate halt | Safety violation | .10 sec | Incident Commander |
| T5 | Emergency shutdown | Existential risk | Immediate | CISO/Executive |

#### A.1.3.3 Autonomy levels

Autonomous agent systems require responsibility assignments that scale with their level of independence from human control. As agents progress from providing information only (L0) to making cross-domain decisions autonomously (L5), the distribution of accountability shifts from end users to application developers, agentic providers, and platform operators. Organizations must classify each agent's autonomy level to determine appropriate governance controls, human oversight requirements, and intervention capabilities outlined in Appendix A.1.3.2.

Classifications adapted from SAE J3016 \[[19](#ref-19), [20](#ref-20), [21](#ref-21), [23](#ref-23), [24](#ref-24), [14](#ref-14), [15](#ref-15)\]

| Level | Name | Human Role | Agent Authority | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| L0 | No automation | Full execution | Information only | Search, Q.A |
| L1 | Human-initiated | Initiates each action | Atomic steps only | Code completion |
| L2 | Human-approved | Reviews/approves plans | Execute after approval | Document drafting |
| L3 | Human-supervised | Active monitoring | Execute within guardrails | Automated testing |
| L4 | Human-on-loop | Exception handling only | Autonomous in domain | Scheduled reports |
| L5 | Full autonomy | Retrospective only | Cross-domain decisions | Research agents |

For AI-specific adaptations of this taxonomy, see \[[23](#ref-23), [24](#ref-24)\]; for empirical data on how autonomy is granted in practice, see \[[14](#ref-14)\].  Note the CSA reference \[[24](#ref-24)\] has no specific author.

**Responsibility Shift by Autonomy Level**

As agent autonomy increases, accountability for agent behavior shifts across the five layers. The following guidance maps autonomy classifications to primary accountability changes:

At L0-L1 (no automation through human-initiated), the end user or organization retains primary accountability for all agent actions, since every operation requires explicit human initiation or approval. The application developer is responsible for ensuring the interface supports informed decision-making.

At L2-L3 (human-approved through human-supervised), accountability for agent behavior shifts to the application developer, who must implement approval workflows (L2) or guardrail enforcement (L3). The agentic provider becomes responsible for providing reliable monitoring and boundary enforcement capabilities that the application developer configures.

At L4-L5 (human-on-loop through full autonomy), the agentic provider assumes shared accountability with the application developer for agent behavior within its operational domain. The organization remains accountable for defining the boundaries of autonomous operation, escalation policies, and intervention capabilities described in the Human Intervention table (Appendix A.1.3.2). At L5, organizations should require contractual accountability clauses from agentic providers covering cross-domain decision outcomes.

Organizations deploying agents at L3 or above should document their autonomy classification in their AI system inventory (see Phase 1, Week 1 of the Implementation Playbook) and review it quarterly as agent capabilities evolve.

## A.3 Applying the Five-Layer AI Shared Responsibility Framework

Below are examples for applying the five-layer AI shared responsibility framework document as system instruction, and example prompts for generating documentation for specific use cases.  
**Example: System instruction**

| *You are an AI governance expert using the CoSAI Five-Layer AI Shared Responsibility Framework (AI SRF) as defined in the attached document "CoSAI Shared Responsibility Framework 2026.pdf" Framework Application: `Apply the five-layer structure (AI Business & Usage → AI Information → AI Application → AI Platform → AI Model Provider) to all scenarios` Assign RACI responsibilities with exactly one accountable party per component Trace requirements downward from business/regulatory needs through technical layers For agentic systems, address autonomy levels (L0-L5) and intervention tiers (T1-T5) Output Format: Scenario Summary Layer Analysis (cite framework sections) Responsibility Matrix (RACI by component) Gaps & Risks Recommendations Evidence Requirements (per Appendix A.7) Key Principles: Never leave accountability ambiguous Ground all analysis in framework definitions and matrices Consider both normal operations and incident response Flag vendor contract misalignments  *  |
| :---- |

### A.3.1 Supply Chain - Third-Party Model Risks

**Example: Framework Application Prompt**

We're evaluating a third-party foundation model from [commercial API / open-source repository / fine-tuned service]. Using AI SRF, create a layer-by-layer due diligence checklist covering: required security attestations (L5), platform security verification (L4), application integration controls (L3-L4), and organizational governance (L1-L2). Identify responsibility gaps and recommend contract language for each layer boundary.

### A.3.2 Incident Response - Framework

**Example: Framework Application Prompt**

A prompt injection attack bypassed our customer service chatbot's guardrails, exposing PII. Map incident response accountability across all AI SRF layers. Who owns detection, containment, eradication, and lessons learned? Create an incident command structure with primary/support roles.

### A.3.3 Risk - Governance Framework

**Example: Framework Application Prompt**

Design an AI governance framework for a [healthcare/financial/manufacturing] organization with [build/buy/hybrid] AI deployment. Using AI SRF, map existing governance bodies (Board, Risk Committee, CISO, Legal) to layer ownership (L1-L5). Define which policies the organization owns (L1-L2) vs. inherits from vendors (L3-L5), how requirements cascade downward, and create a governance charter template with layer-based accountability sections.

### A.3.4 Secure Design - Multi-Agent Security

**Example: Framework Application Prompt**

We're building L4 autonomous agents (human-on-loop) for supplier negotiations using LangChain . Claude on AWS Bedrock. Classify autonomy level, define required human override mechanisms (T1-T5), and assign responsibility for agent behavior boundaries, tool authorization, and escalation procedures across AI SRF layers.

### A.3.5 SAIF Risk Map Integration

**Example: Framework Application Prompt**

Map SAIF risk categories (Data Poisoning, Model Evasion, Model Theft, Prompt Injection, Supply Chain Compromise) to AI SRF accountability dimensions. For each risk, identify: primary risk owner (layer), shared risk owners, control implementation owner(s), control verification owner, and risk acceptance authority.

### A.3.6 Prompt Responsibility Example

The following prompt responsibility framework based on this AI SRF, highlighting the complexity and the two prompt injection responsibility points including the upstream and downstream data sources.

I.e. the person or data steward responsible for the [‘state’ of the inputs](https://github.com/rabbidave/secure-ai-tooling/blob/main/risk-map/docs/artifact-integrity-maturity-pattern.md#artifact-integrity-maturity-model)

![Figure depicting the Prompt Responsibility Model (CoSAl Five-Layer Framework), which maps accountability for prompt generation across three service architectures: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). The diagram shows six distinct layers—Actor, Application, Agentic Layer, LLM Platform, Infrastructure, and Model—illustrating the increasing level of abstraction and system responsibility from underlying infrastructure components (IaaS) to end-user functionality (SaaS).](/shared-responsibility-framework/images/srf-p-img-v1.png)

**Prompt Type Accountability Matrix**

| Prompt Type | IaaS *(Raw infrastructure)* | PaaS | SaaS |
| :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: |

## A.6 Future Evolution and Adaptability

### A.6.1 Emerging Technology Integration

**Advanced Autonomous Systems**: The framework scales to accommodate increasingly autonomous AI systems by adjusting responsibility levels based on autonomy classification. As systems move from reactive to fully autonomous, responsibility distribution shifts accordingly.

**Federated AI Systems**: Cross-organizational AI deployments require enhanced coordination mechanisms, with shared responsibility levels becoming more prevalent and complex coordination procedures.

### A.6.2 Regulatory Evolution

**AI-Specific Legislation**: The framework's regulatory layer accommodates new AI-specific laws (EU AI Act, potential US federal AI legislation) by providing a structure for integrating new requirements across all layers.

**International Harmonization**: As international AI governance frameworks develop, the model supports cross-border compliance through its flexible stakeholder and responsibility structure.

**Industry Standards Development**: Emerging industry standards can be integrated through the existing layer structure without requiring fundamental framework changes.

**Enforcement and Consequence**: The SRF defines *who* is accountable and *what evidence* demonstrates that accountability has been assigned. It does not define consequences for accountability failures; enforcement mechanisms, liability assignment, and remediation obligations are the domain of applicable regulation (EU AI Act \[[11](#ref-11)\], sector-specific law), contracts, and governance policy. Organizations implementing the SRF should ensure their contractual arrangements with vendors and partners at each layer boundary address consequence and remedy, as the framework itself provides the accountability structure those contracts should reference but does not substitute for them.

## A.7 Evidence Requirements

**Purpose**

Each responsibility assignment in this framework requires verifiable evidence. This appendix summarizes evidence categories by layer; detailed requirements are published in the companion *AI SRF Evidence Requirements Workbook*.

### A.7.1 Evidence Categories

| Category | Description | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Governance** | Policies, procedures, approvals | AI Policy, Ethics Review Records |
| **Technical** | Configurations, architectures, artifacts | Model Cards, SBOMs, API Specs |
| **Operational** | Logs, metrics, monitoring outputs | Audit Logs, Telemetry, Alerts |
| **Assessment** | Tests, evaluations, audits | Pen Tests, Bias Evaluations, Red Team Reports |
| **Attestation** | Third-party compliance statements | SOC 2 Type II, ISO Certificates |

### A.7.2 Evidence by Layer

| Layer | Accountable Party | Primary Evidence | Key Artifacts |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **L1: AI Business & Usage** | End User/Organization | Governance, Assessment | AI Policy, Risk Register, Training Records, Audit Reports |
| **L2: AI Information** | End User/Organization . AI Model Provider | Governance, Technical | DPIAs, Dataset Cards, Data Lineage, Consent Records |
| **L3: AI Application** | Application Developer . Agentic Provider | Technical, Assessment | Architecture Docs, Safety Tests, Override Test Results, Agent Telemetry |

| **L5: AI Model Provider** | AI Model Provider | Technical, Assessment | Model Cards, Training Data Docs, Red Team Reports, SLSA Attestations |

### A.7.3 Agentic-Specific Evidence

Autonomous systems require evidence that scales with their classified autonomy level (see A.1.3.3):

L0-L1 (No Automation / Human-Initiated): 

* Minimum evidence requirements apply.   
* Organizations should document tool authorization matrices and maintain standard application logs.   
* Human override testing is not required since humans initiate all actions.

L2-L3 (Human-Approved / Human-Supervised): 

* In addition to L0-L1 requirements, organizations must collect evidence of approval workflow functioning (L2) or guardrail enforcement effectiveness (L3).   
* Agent telemetry should capture reasoning chains and boundary violation attempts.   
* Human override mechanisms require quarterly testing with documented results.

L4-L5 (Human-on-Loop / Full Autonomy): 

* Full evidence collection applies.   
* Required artifacts include: permission matrices with regular access reviews, kill switch test results (monthly or after each deployment), comprehensive action logs with inter-agent communication records, and escalation procedure tests across all intervention tiers (T1-T5).   
* Organizations deploying L5 agents should maintain continuous telemetry and conduct red team exercises against agent decision boundaries at least quarterly.

### A.7.4 Example Vendor Evidence Requirements

| Vendor Type | Minimum Required |
| :---- | :---- |
| AI Model Provider | Model Cards, Training Data Docs, Bias Evaluations, Red Team Results, SBOM |
| Cloud/Platform Provider | SOC 2 Type II, Pen Test Summary, Incident SLAs |
| Agentic Provider | Agent Behavior Docs, Override Mechanism Docs, SOC 2 Type II |
| SaaS AI Provider | All of the above applicable to their stack |

## CoSAI Focus

CoSAI is an OASIS Open Project, bringing together an open ecosystem of AI and security experts from industry-leading organizations. The project is dedicated to sharing best practices for secure AI deployment and collaborating on AI security research and product development. The scope of CoSAI is specifically focused on the secure building, integration, deployment, and operation of AI systems, with an emphasis on mitigating security risks unique to AI technologies. Other aspects of Trustworthy AI are deemed important but beyond the scope of the project including, ethics, fairness, explainability, bias detection, safety, consumer privacy, misinformation, hallucinations, deep fakes, or content safety concerns like hateful or abusive content, malware, or phishing generation. By concentrating on developing robust measures, best practices, and guidelines to safeguard AI systems against unauthorized access, tampering, or misuse, CoSAI aims to contribute to the responsible development and deployment of resilient, secure AI technologies.

**Guidelines on usage of more advanced AI systems (e.g. large language models (LLMs), multi-modal language models. etc) for drafting documents for OASIS CoSAI:**

**TL;DR**: CoSAI contributions are actions performed by humans, who are responsible for the content of those contributions, based on their signed OASIS iCLA (and eCLA, if applicable). [Each contributor must confirm whether they are entitled to donate that material under the applicable open source license; OASIS and the CoSAI Project do not separately confirm that.] Each contributor is responsible for ensuring that all contributions comply with these AI use guidelines, including disclosure of any use of AI in contributions.

* Selection of AI systems: CoSAI recommends the use of reputable AI systems (lowering the risk of inadvertently incorporating infringing material).  
* Model constraints: Currently, CoSAI or OASIS are not required to have a contract or financial agreement for using AI systems from specific vendors. However, CoSAI editors should consider employing varying tools to avoid potential fairness concerns among vendors.  
* IP infringement: It is the responsibility of the individual who subscribes/prompts and receives a response from an AI system to confirm they have the right to repost and donate the content to OASIS under our rules.  
* Transparency: CoSAI’s goal will be to maintain transparency throughout the process by documenting substantial use of AI systems whenever possible (e.g., the prompts and the AI system used), and to ensure that all content, regardless of production by human or AI systems, was reviewed and edited by human experts. This helps build trust in the standards development process and ensures accountability.  
* Human-edited content and quality control: CoSAI mandates human-reviewed or -edited results for any final outputs. A robust quality control process should be in place, involving careful review of the generated content for accuracy, relevance, and alignment with CoSAI's goals and principles. Human experts should scrutinize the output of AI systems to identify any errors, inconsistencies, or potential biases.  
* Iterative refinement: The use of AI systems in drafting standards should be seen as an iterative process, with the generated content serving as a starting point for further refinement and improvement by human experts. Multiple rounds of review and editing may be necessary to ensure the final standards meet the required quality and reliability thresholds.
